# {{$frontmatter.title}}

API3 is open to any proposals and improvements. Please feel free to contribute.

- opening issues
- making pull requests
- proposing features

Individuals with a technical background can contribute to the project (through
development, integrations, writing documentation, etc.). The general point is
that one needs to be able to use a solution proficiently before being able to
improve it.

## Prerequisites

it is recommended to do all of the below before attempting to contribute, and
make sure to ask any questions you have on
[Discord<ExternalLinkImage/>](https://discord.gg/qnRrcfnm5W).

- If you do not have any blockchain development experience, read
  [Mastering Ethereum<ExternalLinkImage/>](https://github.com/ethereumbook/ethereumbook)
  cover to cover. It is a light read that touches on all subjects that you will
  need to know about superficially.

- To get a general grasp of the project, read the
  <a href="/api3-whitepaper-v1.0.3.pdf" target="_api3-whitepaper">API3<ExternalLinkImage/>
  Whitepaper</a> and our
  [Blog Posts on Medium<ExternalLinkImage/>](https://medium.com/api3).

- Read the entirety of these docs. Take notes and cross-reference, but do not
  expect to understand everything. Feel free to ask questions.

- Run and understand the Airnode starter tutorial

- (Optional, but ideal) Integrate an API to an Airnode without using any guide,
  deploy the Airnode, and build a dApp that uses the Airnode. Better yet, join
  one of our hackathons.

- (For the curious) Explore all the repos hosted on
  [GitHub<ExternalLinkImage/>](https://github.com/api3dao), go through the
  issues, PRs, etc.

This page will be updated as more materials are produced. Please feel free to
create
[GitHub issues<ExternalLinkImage/>](https://github.com/api3dao/vitepress-docs/issues)
to make suggestions.
