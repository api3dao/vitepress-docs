# API3 Market

API3 has developed an oracle solution that enables smart contracts to access and
utilize valuable real-world data with ease. As such it is essential to make sure
the process of accessing this data is as user-friendly and efficient as
possible.

### What is the API3 Market?

The API3 Market provides tooling for Smart contract developers access dAPIs.
Through the [API3 Market<ExternalLinkImage/>](https://market.api3.org) data
feeds are easily searched, monitored, and consumed.

From the API3 Market developers will manage all data feed subscriptions. Once
the dAPI interface has been imported to a dApps contracts, upgrading a data feed
happens through the API3 Market.

### Reading a dAPI

Currently, self-funded dAPIs can be accessed through a quick and simple process:

1. Exploring and selecting your data feed
2. Funding a sponsor wallet
3. Accessing a data feed through a proxy
