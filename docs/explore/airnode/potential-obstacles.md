# {{$frontmatter.title}}

As a part of its previous efforts, API3 communicated with API providers
extensively. We observed a number of obstacles that might prevent them from
oracle onboarding and operation, the most important of which we have outlined
below.

## Lack of familiarity

Traditional API providers are typically not more familiar with blockchain
technologies than the general public. This applies even for the ones that curate
cryptocurrency market data—as their main operation is collecting data from
exchange APIs, processing them, and serving the result through their own
APIs—which does not require any blockchain-specific know-how. Therefore, they
typically cannot readily operate an oracle node with in-house resources.

## The problem of node operators

There is no job market for oracle node operators. Even if some API provider were
to obtain the specific know-how needed by hiring the few node operators that are
available, this would not be a scalable solution.

Operating an oracle node consumes a lot of resources in the form of person-hours
and infrastructure costs. Unless one is guaranteed significant subsidies or
future profits, operating an oracle node is financially infeasible.

## Using cryptocurrencies

Operating an oracle node requires the API providers to transact with
cryptocurrencies. Specifically, they must pay for gas costs in the native
currency (e.g., ETH) and receive payments in one or more cryptocurrencies. This
disqualifies the vast majority of API providers for compliance-related, legal
and accounting reasons. In addition, any scheme that requires API providers to
stake funds is categorically rejected for similar reasons related to financial
risks.

## What about the advantages?

Although these potential barriers might seem off-putting at first, there are
several compelling reasons for which it is still worth considering operating an
oracle node. With first-party oracle nodes, there are, in fact, practical
solutions to most of the issues above. Read more about them (in this
