An example AWS value would be us-east-1 and an example GCP value would be us-east1. See the cloud provider&#39;s documentation for possible values, though not all regions can be deployed to. For GCP, make sure to choose a region and not a zone, and see the list below for regions that have been confirmed to work. For AWS, some regions are disabled by default and you must [enable them] (https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/rande-manage.html) before you can create and manage resources. Note that transferring a deployment from one region to the other is not trivial (i.e., it does not take one command like deployment, but rather three) and is not advised.

For example, the same Airnode may have multiple deployments with stage set to a different value (dev, public, prod). stage cannot be longer than 16 characters and can only include lowercase alphanumeric characters (a–z, 0–9) and hyphens (-).  triggers [#] (#triggers)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------  An array that maps external triggers such as a request made through RRP (or a subscription made through PSP, which is not implemented yet) to an endpoint defined in an OIS. json// triggers { &quot;rrp&quot;: [ { &quot;endpointId&quot;: &quot;0xd7ddc8ee64d6e540682ec844a5dd9737663ec3afe5751102eb4f966744751838&quot;, &quot;oisTitle&quot;: &quot;myOisTitle&quot;, &quot;endpointName&quot;: &quot;myEndpointName&quot;, &quot;cacheResponses&quot;: false } ], &quot;http&quot;: [ { &quot;endpointId&quot;: &quot;0xd7ddc8ee64d6e540682ec844a5dd9737663ec3afe5751102eb4f966744751838&quot;, &quot;oisTitle&quot;: &quot;myOisTitle&quot;, &quot;endpointName&quot;: &quot;myEndpointName&quot; } ], &quot;httpSignedData&quot;: [ { &quot;endpointId&quot;: &quot;0xd7ddc8ee64d6e540682ec844a5dd9737663ec3afe5751102eb4f966744751838&quot;, &quot;oisTitle&quot;: &quot;myOisTitle&quot;, &quot;endpointName&quot;: &quot;myEndpointName&quot; } ] }  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 In the example above, the Airnode deployment has an OIS with the title myOisTitle. This OIS has an endpoint with the name myEndpointName. When the Airnode deployment detects a [request] (./../../concepts/request.html) that references its [airnodeAddress] (./../../concepts/airnode.html#airnodeaddress) and 0xd7ddc8ee64d6e540682ec844a5dd9737663ec3afe5751102eb4f966744751838 as the [endpointId] (./../../concepts/endpoint.html#endpointid) , it will call the specified endpoint (myOisTitle-myEndpointName) with the parameters provided in the request to fulfill it. See the [endpoint id documentation] (./../../concepts/endpoint.html#endpointid) for the default convention for deriving the endpointId.  rrp [#] (#rrp)   (required) - An array of endpoints from OIS that the Airnode will respond to via the RRP protocol [AirnodeRrpV0.sol] (./../../concepts/) .  rrp[n].endpointId [#] (#rrp-n-endpointid)   (required) - A identifier derived for an oisTitle/endpointName pair. For derivation see: [derive-endpoint-id] (./../packages/admin-cli.html#derive-endpoint-id) .  rrp[n].oisTitle [#] (#rrp-n-oistitle)   (required) - The title of an OIS object.  rrp[n].endpointName [#] (#rrp-n-endpointname)   (required) - The endpoint name of an OIS endpoint.  rrp[n].cacheResponses [#] (#rrp-n-cacheresponses)   (required) - Whether to cache API responses for an endpoint by requestId and return the cached response. Useful for non-idempotent API operations like random number generators.  http [#] (#http)   (required) - An array of endpoints from OIS that the Airnode will respond to via the HTTP gateway.  http[n].endpointId [#] (#http-n-endpointid)   (required) - A identifier derived for an oisTitle/endpointName pair. For derivation see: [derive-endpoint-id] (./../packages/admin-cli.html#derive-endpoint-id) .  http[n].oisTitle [#] (#http-n-oistitle)   (required) - The title of an OIS object.  http[n].endpointName [#] (#http-n-endpointname)   (required) - The endpoint name of an OIS endpoint.  httpSignedData [#] (#httpsigneddata)   (required) - An array of endpoints from OIS that the Airnode will respond to via the HTTP Signed Data Gateway.  httpSignedData[n].endpointId [#] (#httpsigneddata-n-endpointid)   (required) - A identifier derived for an oisTitle/endpointName pair, see [derive-endpoint-id] (./../packages/admin-cli.html#derive-endpoint-id) .  httpSignedData[n].oisTitle [#] (#httpsigneddata-n-oistitle)   (required) - The title of an OIS object.  httpSignedData[n].endpointName [#] (#httpsigneddata-n-endpointname)   (required) - The endpoint name of an OIS endpoint.  templates [#] (#templates)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------  An array that includes the necessary information to make [Template Requests] (./../../concepts/request.html#template-request) . The templates array must be included in the config.json file. The array can be left empty if no templates are used . Valid templates will be used to make template requests without calling the contract to fetch the template from the chain. For details see [Using Templates] (./../../grp-developers/using-templates.html) . json// templates [ { &quot;templateId&quot;: &quot;0x02834eb43d56133982b7d6e5aa8b466c7ea4ba0fadf697698c1fee0996bba0fc&quot;, &quot;endpointId&quot;: &quot;0xd9e8c9bcc8960df5f954c0817757d2f7f9601bd638ea2f94e890ae5481681153&quot;, &quot;encodedParameters&quot;: &quot;0x3173000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000636f696e49640000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000657468657265756d000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000&quot; } ]  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8  templateId [#] (#templateid)   (required: for each row in templates) - An identifier derived by hashing the Airnode address, the endpointId and the encoded parameters of the template. For derivation see: [Templates] (./../../concepts/template.html#templateid) .  endpointId [#] (#endpointid)   (required: for each row in templates) - An identifier derived for an oisTitle/endpointName pair. For derivation see: [derive-endpoint-id] (./../packages/admin-cli.html#derive-endpoint-id) .  encodedParameters [#] (#encodedparameters)   (required: for each row in templates) - The encoded request parameters.  ois [#] (#ois)  -----------------------------------------------------------------  A list of OIS objects. Since each OIS specifies the integration of an API to an oracle, a single Airnode deployment can serve multiple APIs. To avoid duplication of content, see the [API Integration] (./../../grp-providers/guides/build-an-airnode/api-integration.html) guide and the [Oracle Integration Specifications (OIS)] (/ois/v1.2/) documentation.  apiCredentials [#] (#apicredentials)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Each entry in apiCredentials maps to a security scheme defined in an OIS (ois[n].components.securitySchemes.{securitySchemeName}), where oisTitle is the title field of the related OIS, and securitySchemeName is the name of the respective security scheme. These would be myOisTitle and mySecurityScheme in the example below. securitySchemeValue is the value used for the authentication with the security scheme (e.g., the API key) which would be in secrets.env in the example below. For more implementation details, see the [API Security] (./../../grp-providers/guides/build-an-airnode/api-security.html) documentation. The security field in the OIS object must be included and hold the names of all security schemes the API operation Note that if you do not need a security scheme, leave the apiCredentials array empty. json// apiCredentials [ { &quot;oisTitle&quot;: &quot;myOisTitle&quot;, &quot;securitySchemeName&quot;: &quot;mySecurityScheme&quot;, &quot;securitySchemeValue&quot;: &quot;${SS_MY_API_KEY}&quot; } ] // components and security field in OIS object { &quot;title&quot;: &quot;myOisTitle&quot;, ..., &quot;components&quot;: { &quot;securitySchemes&quot;: { &quot;mySecurityScheme&quot;: { &quot;in&quot;: &quot;header&quot;, &quot;type&quot;: &quot;apiKey&quot;, &quot;name&quot;: &quot;X-api-key&quot; } } }, &quot;security&quot;: { &quot;mySecurityScheme&quot; [] } ... }  1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27  oisTitle [#] (#oistitle)   (required: for each row in apiCredentials) - The ois.title of the OIS where the securitySchemeName can be found.  securitySchemeName [#] (#securityschemename)   (required: for each row in apiCredentials) - The name of a security scheme from ois[n].components.securitySchemes.{securitySchemeName}.  securitySchemeValue [#] (#securityschemevalue)   (required: for each row in apiCredentials) - The value of the security scheme used (as defined by ois[n].components.securitySchemes.{securitySchemeName} for the authentication. Usually stored in secrets.env.
