The API3 DAO has installed two instances of its voting app, primary and secondary versions, along with two Aragon Agents that they control. The primary commands a larger treasury and can update all DAO settings, while the secondary commands a much smaller treasury and can update some of the DAO settings. See the [Api3Voting.sol] (https://github.com/api3dao/api3-dao/blob/main/packages/api3-voting/contracts/Api3Voting.sol) ➚ contract code and the Aragon contracts it inherits from. ---BaseTemplate  Key Functions [#] (#key-functions)    SignatureDescription newVote(bytes _executionScript, string _metadata, bool _castVote, bool _executesIfDecided) returns (uint256 voteId) Create a new proposal in the DAO. Requires a minimum percentage of voting power (currently 0.1%). vote(uint256 _voteId, bool _supports, bool _executesIfDecided) Vote yes or no on an existing proposal. executeVote(uint256 _voteId) Execute a proposal, if it is ready for execution. A proposal is ready for execution if: 1--the proposal hasn&#39;t already been executed, and 2--greater than 50% of all voting power has voted &quot;yes&quot; on the proposal, OR 1--the proposal hasn&#39;t already been executed, and 2--the proposal&#39;s voting period has ended, and 3--the total &quot;yes&quot; vote exceeds the &quot;no&quot; vote, and 4--at least 50% (for Primary voting app proposals) or 15% (for Secondary voting app proposals) of all voting power has voted &quot;yes&quot; on the proposal.
