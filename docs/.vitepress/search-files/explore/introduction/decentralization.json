Nevertheless, they cannot be considered as a full solution for all use cases. This is because a first-party oracle is operated by a single API provider and only serves their API. Then, using a single first-party oracle creates centralization at the API level, and requires the API provider to be trusted. This is not acceptable in some use cases, e.g., if the use case secures a large amount of funds.  Decentralized Governance [#] (#decentralized-governance)  -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  In such cases as mentioned above, oracle networks provide the required decentralization. An oracle network makes the same request to multiple independent oracles and reduces their responses to a single answer through predetermined consensus rules implemented as a smart contract called the aggregator. Individual malicious oracles cannot manipulate the outcome of this process, which provides a degree of decentralization and trustlessness. ![image] (/assets/central-governance.38eed589.png) TODO The diagram above and below do not illustrate the governance issue well. They need to be blended into one. ![image] (/assets/decentral-governance.daa8ea53.png) Here, an important thing to consider is how the oracle network is governed. If a central entity can switch the oracles or APIs used in the aggregator in and out, or even replace the aggregator itself making use of a proxy mechanism, they can effectively manipulate the oracle network output at will. This eliminates the decentralization and trustlessness qualities that using an oracle network provides. Therefore, it is not adequate to use an oracle network for decentralization, this oracle network must be governed decentrally as well. See the medium article, [Why API3 DAO, not API3 CORP?] (https://medium.com/api3/why-api3-dao-not-api3-corp-2dde51c537c1) ➚ on DAOs and decentralized governance.  dAPI (Decentralized API) [#] (#dapi-decentralized-api)  ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  Consider the following: ---Decentralized applications need access to APIs. ---APIs should be interfaced to smart contract platforms through first-party oracles. ---For API level decentralization, decentrally-governed oracle networks should be employed.s It can be concluded that decentrally-governed networks of first-party oracles solve the API connectivity problem. Although this is technically correct, the same solution can be reached through a more useful lens. Decentralized applications cannot access Web APIs, and oracle solutions aim to build decentralized interfaces to facilitate this. However, this approach results in an inferior solution and ecosystem (see the [API3 Whitepaper] (/api3-whitepaper-v1.0.3.pdf) ➚ for a detailed explanation). ![image] (/assets/dapi.d21ac629.png) Instead, API3 builds complete products called decentralized APIs (dAPIs for short), which are blockchain-native, decentralized API services. From the user&#39;s (i.e., the entity that operates the decentralized application) perspective, the experience of using a dAPI would be very similar to a Web developer using a traditional API; they would find a dAPI they need, pay the subscription fee, and enjoy access. Due to being defined as a full product rather than an interface, unlike a traditional oracle network, a dAPI includes the underlying APIs. This results in a superior solution (secure and cost-efficient first-party oracles) and ecosystem (with API providers as its members).
