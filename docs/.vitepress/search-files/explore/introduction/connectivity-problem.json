In the context of decentralized applications, this definition is quite useless, and even misguiding. Instead, we should see APIs as channels businesses use to monetize their data and services. Take the [CoinMarketCap API] (https://coinmarketcap.com/api/) ➚ as an example. It allows Web developers to use all the data seen on [https://coinmarketcap.com/] (https://coinmarketcap.com/) ➚ and more in their applications programmatically by making API calls. In return, developers pay a [subscription fee] (https://coinmarketcap.com/api/pricing/) ➚ . In practice, any kind of data or service that is worth using is served by a paid API. ![image] (/assets/coinmarketcap.d0f52a90.png) See the article, [APIs: The Digital Glue] (https://medium.com/api3/apis-the-digital-glue-7ac87566e773) ➚ for a more complete background on APIs.  Oracles [#] (#oracles)  ---  A smart contract cannot access data that is not presently in the blockchain, which is commonly known as the oracle problem. This is only worth consideration because it includes not being able to call the paid (read: useful) APIs described above. All the game theoretic and cryptographic methods proposed for various oracle solutions essentially aim to provide smart contracts access to these paid APIs. Therefore, it would be more accurate to define the problem at hand as the API connectivity problem. As you read about API3 offerings, you will discover that this redefinition will have ripple effects across the entire solution, from how the ecosystem is built to the lowest levels of the protocol. See the article, [The API Connectivity Problem] (https://medium.com/api3/the-api-connectivity-problem-bd7fa0420636) ➚ for a more relative information.  API Providers [#] (#api-providers)    API provider is a term that is criminally underused by existing oracle solutions. It refers to the business that owns and operates the API that the decentralized application needs to receive data and services from. Then, it is only natural for the API provider to be a point of consideration in the solution of the API connectivity problem. Airnode was built on this premise. Airnode is a first-party, API provider owned and operated oracle node that provides a meaningful focus on the business of each API provider.  What are first-party oracles? [#] (#what-are-first-party-oracles)  -  An oracle is an agent that acts as an intermediary between a smart contract platform and an API. In other words, a decentralized application can use an oracle to call an API. ![image] (/assets/oracle.71fb4547.png) An oracle consists of two parts: ---The oracle node that acts as a proxy, i.e., listens for requests made on the blockchain, calls the API over the Web, fulfills the requests by making transactions on the blockchain. Note that the oracle node is a traditional application that needs hosting. ---The smart contracts that implement the protocol defining how decentralized applications can make requests to the oracle and receive responses. This part is deployed on-chain and runs trustlessly, i.e., no specific party needs to host it. Based on this information, it looks like simply having an oracle solves the API connectivity problem. However, there is an important point to consider: Who will host the oracle node? 1--If an API provider hosts the oracle node, the oracle is called a first-party oracle. 2--If a third-party middleman hosts the oracle node, the oracle is called a third-party oracle. Third party oracles are both insecure and expensive (see the [API3 Whitepaper] (/api3-whitepaper-v1.0.3.pdf#page=10) ➚ Issues with Third-Party Oracles as Middlemen for a detailed explanation). In contrast, first-party oracles are both secure and cost-efficient due to not having a middleman on the interface path.
