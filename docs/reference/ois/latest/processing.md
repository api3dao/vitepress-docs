# {{$frontmatter.title}}

The processing schema accepts an array of processing snippets (user defined
code) which are chained. The first snippet receives parameters submitted as part
of a template or on-chain request. The output of this snippet is passed to the
second snippet and so on.

Airnode executes snippets for `preProcessingSpecifications` and
`postProcessingSpecifications` during its run cycle. The following describes the
work flow Airnode uses:

1. Run `preProcessingSpecifications`
2. Airnode calls requested OIS endpoint
3. Run `postProcessingSpecifications`
4. Airnode encodes the response values defined by reservedParameters

The processing schema is the same for both
[`preProcessingSpecifications`](/reference/ois/latest/specification.md#_5-9-preprocessingspecifications)
and
[`postProcessingSpecifications`](/reference/ois/latest/specification.md#_5-10-postprocessingspecifications).
Snippets for both specifications follow this schema:

- `environment` - Currently one of `Node` or `Node async`. Both options
  interpret the code as JavaScript and execute in Node.js. The async version can
  use asynchronous code. The code snippet is expected to call `resolve(output)`
  with the output value as an argument. Airnode will use the resolved value as
  the input to subsequent snippets (if defined).
- `value` - The processing code written as a string.
- `timeoutMs` - The maximum timeout that this snippet can run. In case the
  timeout is exceeded an error is thrown.

Try the [Post processing](/guides/airnode/post-processing/) guide to further
understand pre/post processing.

## Input and Output

The processing snippet receives an `input` value which is either the initial
value or the output value from the previous processing snippet. The snippet must
create a variable `output` which will be used for the next processing snippet.
The processing snippet can use most Node.js built-in modules. Refer to the
source code of Airnode to understand how processing works and what modules are
made available to the snippet code. Modules cannot be imported directly in cloud
environments.

## Accessing endpoint parameters

Endpoint parameters, with the exception of reserved parameters, are accessible
within pre-processing and post-processing via the immutable `endpointParameters`
object. For example, if there was a parameter named `myParameter` defined in the
`endpoints[n].parameters` array, its value could be accessed using
`endpointParameters.myParameter` within pre-processing and post-processing code
snippets.

::: info Accessing reserved parameters

Note that reserved parameters are inaccessible in both pre-processing and
post-processing.

## Interpolation

Note, that config.json supports interpolation of secrets via the JavaScript
string interpolation pattern (e.g `${SECRET_NAME}`). This syntax conflicts with
the string interpolation inside the processing snippets. In order to use the
interpolation in snippets, you need to escape the interpolation.

For example, the following code:

```js
console.log(`Received input ${input}`);
const output = input;
```

should be escaped inside the `config.json` like this:

```json
{
  "environment": "Node",
  "timeoutMs": 5000,
  "value": "console.log(`Received input \\${input}`);\nconst output = input;"
}
```

## Error Handling and Security

Processing code is expected to be trustworthy as it is specified by the Airnode
operator. Processing is an advanced feature that carries great security risks.
It is therefore advised that developers using the processing feature familiarize
themselves with the Airnode sources prior to developing any processing code
snippets.

Processing code executes in a constrained execution environment resembling
Node.js. Some resources may not be available, for example the `require`
statement. Therefore code should be tested thoroughly in the target environment
(e.g. Lambda and/or Docker client). For example, authentication implemented in
pre-processing should always be executed at the end of the respective processing
chain and special care should be taken to avoid leakage of secrets.

## Skip the API call

Not all Airnode endpoints need to call an API. An Airnode endpoint can rely on
either (or both) pre-processing or post-processing to acquire a value for the
Airnode to place on-chain.

Instead of calling an API, Airnode uses the output of
`preProcessingSpecifications`, `postProcessingSpecifications`, or both. The
field `operation` must be undefined, `fixedOperationParameters` must be an empty
array and one of `preProcessingSpecifications` or `postProcessingSpecifications`
must be defined and not be an empty array.

### Use case: random number

An Airnode endpoint that places a random number on-chain. Rather than calling an
API, the Airnode will derive a random number during its execution of a
pre-process specification. A requester would make a request of this Airnode
endpoint without parameters. The Airnode endpoint simply sets the random number
on-chain in response to the request using a `preProcessingSpecifications`
specification. Example #1 below implements this use case.

### Example #1

This example creates an Airnode endpoint named `generateRandomNumber` with no
parameters. Because there isn't an
[operation field](/reference/ois/latest/specification.md#_5-2-operation) defined
for this Airnode endpoint, a call to an API will not be made. The Airnode will
instead execute a single specification defined in the
[preProcessingSpecifications](/reference/ois/latest/specification.md#_5-9-preprocessingspecifications)
array.

To implement the use case mentioned above, the
[operation field](/reference/ois/latest/specification.md#_5-2-operation) will be
undefined, `fixedOperationParameters` will be an empty array, and
`preProcessingSpecifications` will be defined with a single specification.

- A requester makes a request of the Airnode endpoint `generateRandomNumber`
  without any parameters.
- Airnode runs the specification in `preProcessingSpecifications[0]`.
- The specification generates a random number.
- The reserved parameter named `randomNumber` now holds the random number.
- Airnode places the value on-chain and makes a callback to the requester.

```json
endpoints: [
  {
    "name": "generateRandomNumber",
    "fixedOperationParameters": [],
    "parameters": [],
    "preProcessingSpecifications": [
      {
        "environment": "Node",
        "timeoutMs": 5000,
        "value": "output = {randomNumber: Math.floor(Math.random() * 100)}"
      }
    ],
    "reservedParameters": [
      {
        "fixed": "uint256",
        "name": "_type"
      },
      {
        "fixed": "randomNumber",
        "name": "_path"
      },
      {
        "name": "_times"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```

### Example #2

The code below is unrelated to the
[use case](/reference/ois/latest/processing.md#use-case-random-number) mentioned
earlier. This example creates an Airnode endpoint named
`endpointThatSumsWith1000` with a parameter named `numberToSum`. Because there
isn't an
[operation field](/reference/ois/latest/specification.md#_5-2-operation) defined
for this Airnode endpoint, a call to an API will not be made. The Airnode will
instead execute a single specification defined in the
[preProcessingSpecifications](/reference/ois/latest/specification.md#_5-9-preprocessingspecifications)
array.

- A requester passes the number `5` in the parameter named `numberToSum`.
- Airnode runs the specification in `preProcessingSpecifications[0]`.
- The specification adds 1000 to the value of `numberToSum`.
- The reserved parameter named `inputsSumWith1000` now holds the value of 1005.
- Airnode places the value on-chain and makes a callback to the requester.

```json
endpoints: [
  {
    "name": "endpointThatSumsWith1000",
    "fixedOperationParameters": [],
    "parameters": [
      {
        "name": "numberToSum",
        "operationParameter": {
          "in": "path",
          "name": "numberToSum"
        }
      }
    ],
    "preProcessingSpecifications": [
      {
        "environment": "Node",
        "timeoutMs": 5000,
        "value": "output = {inputsSumWith1000: parseInt(input.numberToSum) + 1000}"
      }
    ],
    "reservedParameters": [
      {
        "fixed": "uint256",
        "name": "_type"
      },
      {
        "fixed": "inputsSumWith1000",
        "name": "_path"
      },
      {
        "name": "_times"
      }
    ]
  }
]
```
