# {{$frontmatter.title}}

Differences in chain design inevitably lead to some unique chain-specific
considerations. Below are idiosyncrasies we have identified, though it may not
be comprehensive and we are interested in hearing if you encounter others.

## config.json - `chains` field

The idiosyncrasies below relate to the `chains` field of `config.json` discussed
in
[Configuring Airnode](/reference/airnode/next/understand/configuring.md#chains)
and
[Deployment Files](/reference/airnode/next/deployment-files/config-json.md#chains)
section.

### Avalanche

Gas prices on Avalanche mainnet are often underestimated when getting `type 0`
estimates (e.g. for the `providerRecommendedGasPrice` strategy). The error
manifests as the `maxFeePerGas` being set to less than the block
`baseFeePerGas`, resulting in unfulfilled requests. A solution to this is to set
`recommendedGasPriceMultiplier` to slightly greater than `1` e.g. `1.1`.

### Arbitrum

Execution costs on Arbitrum are calculated slightly differently than Ethereum,
which impacts the gas required to fulfill requests. To account for this, it is
recommended to use a minimum value of `5000000` for `fulfillmentGasLimit` when
using both Arbitrum mainnet and testnet. Note that `fulfillmentGasLimit` is
optional, so if it is not specified, Airnode will attempt to estimate the
appropriate gas limit automatically. Read more about
[ArbGas](https://developer.offchainlabs.com/docs/arbgas) gas and fees.

### Metis

On the Metis testnet Stardust, though not on the Metis mainnet Andromeda, it is
recommended to use a `fulfillmentGasLimit` of at least `5000000`. Note that
`fulfillmentGasLimit` is optional, so if it is not specified, Airnode will
attempt to estimate the appropriate gas limit automatically.

### Optimism

Using `type 0` transaction types is recommended over `type 2` so the use of
`providerRecommendedEip1559GasPrice` is discouraged.

As a L2 scaling solution, Optimism has an L1 data fee and an L2 execution fee,
which are
[accounted for separately](https://docs.optimism.io/stack/transactions/fees). To
cover the L1 data fee when a sponsor requests a
[withdrawal](/reference/airnode/next/concepts/sponsor.md#withdrawals), an amount
has to be subtracted from the funds returned to the sponsor. The
`withdrawalRemainder` parameter has been introduced specifically for this
reason, though the value required will differ between Optimism mainnet and
testnet due to differences in L1 gas fees. For Optimism testnet, a
`withdrawalRemainder` of `1 gwei` should suffice, while for Optimism mainnet, a
value as high as `2.4 finney` (`2400000 gwei`) may be required in order to cover
an L1 gas price of `300 gwei` and `8000` L1 gas used by the transaction.
