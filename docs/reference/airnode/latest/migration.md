# {{$frontmatter.title}}

The following guide assumes a valid v0.11.2 `config.json` file. All changes
listed below will need to be implemented in order to migrate to Airnode v0.12.0.
This document is written in a way that will preserve existing behavior with
earlier Airnode versions.

The document also mentions changes to user facing services related to Airnode,
such as airnode-deployer, airnode-admin, etc., and new features.

## Summary

1. `ois[n].oisFormat` updated to "2.1.0". This has not changed since v0.11.2,
   but has changed since v0.11.0 and v0.11.1 for which it was "2.0.0".

2. `nodeSettings.nodeVersion` updated to "0.12.0".

3. Fields specifying `AirnodeRrpV0` and `RequesterAuthorizerWithErc721` contract
   addresses on chains for which there is an API3 deployment are now optional.
   See details below for additional information.

## Details

1. `ois[n].oisFormat`

Updated to "2.1.0". This has not changed since v0.11.2, but has changed since
v0.11.0 and v0.11.1 for which it was "2.0.0".

```diff
{
- "oisFormat": "2.0.0"
+ "oisFormat": "2.1.0"
}
```

2. `nodeSettings.nodeVersion`

Updated to "0.12.0"

```diff
{
- "nodeVersion": "0.11.2"
+ "nodeVersion": "0.12.0"
}
```

3. `AirnodeRrpV0` and `RequesterAuthorizerWithErc721` addresses are now optional
   if there is an API3 deployment for that contract on the specified chain. A
   table of such deployments can be found on the
   [Contract Addresses](/reference/airnode/latest/index.md) page. The following
   illustrates how the addresses can be omitted. First, within the `chains[n]`
   object:

```diff
{
- "contracts": {
-   "AirnodeRrp": "0x..."
- },
}
```

And second, within the `chains[n].authorizers` object:

```diff
{
  "authorizers": {
    "requesterEndpointAuthorizers": [],
    "crossChainRequesterAuthorizers": [
      {
        "requesterEndpointAuthorizers": ["0x..."],
        "chainType": "evm",
        "chainId": "5",
-       "contracts": {
-         "AirnodeRrp": "0x..."
-       },
        "chainProvider": {
          "url": "http://127.0.0.2"
        }
      }
    ],
    "requesterAuthorizersWithErc721": [
      {
-       "RequesterAuthorizerWithErc721": "0x...",
        "erc721s": ["0x..."]
      }
    ],
    "crossChainRequesterAuthorizersWithErc721": [
      {
        "erc721s": ["0x..."],
        "chainType": "evm",
        "chainId": "5",
-       "contracts": {
-         "RequesterAuthorizerWithErc721": "0x..."
-       },
        "chainProvider": {
          "url": "http://127.0.0.2"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## New features and updates

- There is no longer a hardcoded limit to the maximum number of sponsor wallet
  requests processed each cycle.
- The following changes were made to the HTTP gateway:
  1. Data is returned from successful API calls that fail response processing.
     For an example see the
     [HTTP Gateways](/reference/airnode/latest/understand/http-gateways.md#http-gateway)
     page.
  2. Reserved parameters are inaccessible in response pre/post processing. This
     is only relevant if reserved parameters are being _modified_ in pre/post
     processing (advanced use case).
- The `value` for a `fixedOperationParameters` object is now allowed to be any
  type, including an object; for example, the following specifies an array
  containing multiple primitives. This has not changed since v0.11.2, but has
  changed since v0.11.0 and v0.11.1 for which it was only allowed to be a
  string.

  ```json
  {
    "fixedOperationParameters": [
      {
        "operationParameter": {
          "in": "query",
          "name": "params"
        },
        "value": ["finalized", false]
      }
    ]
  }
  ```
