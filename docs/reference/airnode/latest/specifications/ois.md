The `ois` JSON object, in the `config.json` file that defines an Airnode, is an
integral part of an Airnode's understanding of an API's specification and its
endpoints. OIS provide a description of API endpoints and maps Airnode endpoints
to them. There can be more than one OIS object in the `config.json` file as
Airnode can serve endpoints from more than one API.
