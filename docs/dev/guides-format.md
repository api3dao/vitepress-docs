# {{$frontmatter.title}}

Guides can be broken into two categories.

- How to
- Tutorial

## How to

This type of guide does not engage in a step-by-step instructional page. Often
it is short with a code example and a paragraph or two explaining the code
example. A majority of readers appreciate how to guides rather than tutorials.

## Tutorial

This type if guide steps the reader through a progression. Each step in the
progression is numbered. Once the progression starts it must be contiguous until
the progression ends. There can only be un-numbers sections (heading2) before
and after the progression. Each progression section must be heading2 and each
start with a number followed by a period _(1.)_. See the
[Deploying an Airnode on AWS](/guides/airnode/deploy-airnode/deploy-aws/) guide
as an example.

Each section in the progression must instruct the reader to do something, an
action. Sections that are purely instructional must be placed before or after
the progression. Sections in the progression can contain instructional
explanations as they are related to the action the reader must perform.

## Directory structure

Most guides use a simple directory structure to contain its markdown and other
asset files locally. As a rule the primary markdown page is named `index.md`. In
the example below, `src` might contain images, code sample, and other required
files.

```sh
testnets-metamask
├── src
└── index.md
```

## Other formatting rules

1. Single page layout using markdown elements.
1. Minimize use of Vue components if any.
1. Simple (post heading 1) intro.
1. Each section (heading 2) involved in the guide’s progression is numbered.
1. Each section (heading 2) should fit (if possible) within the height of a
   developer sized screen.
1. Avoid the use of heading 3-n sections if possible.
1. Operations related to any clicking widgets (panes, button, pick-list, etc.)
   are in bold.
1. For tutorials, “unnumbered” sections (heading 2) can precede or follow a
   series of numbered steps ( the tutorial's progression) which must be
   contiguous. See the
   [Deploying an Airnode on AWS](/guides/airnode/deploy-airnode/deploy-aws/)
   guide as an example.
