API3 uses CloudFlare for DNS records which includes the docs. If SSR is turned
on for any domain related to the docs, then CloudFlare will minify the already
minified build files from Firebase. This will result in the merging of pages
visible to the reader.

Because the docs are not using SSR and relying are on a CDN (Firebase), caching
isn't necessary. The CDN is effectively a cache as the data is static. So
caching for DNS records related to the docs should be turned off.
