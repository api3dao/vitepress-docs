# {{$frontmatter.title}}

Consider the following markdown based links in a file
`/reference/ois/latest/specifications.md`.

- `/reference/ois/latest/reserved-parameters.md#gasprice`

- `reserved-parameters.md#gasprice`

- `./reserved-parameters.md#gasprice`

Because `reserved-parameters.md` is in the same folder as `specifications.md`,
all three links will work. However with the later two links, VitePress will add
`/reference/ois/latest/` at SPA runtime. This is problematic for link validator
scripts such as `/lib/link-validator.js`.

During the release of VitePress 1.0.0-alpha.46 someone thought it best to add
the base path to all markdown URLS at runtime. This was not thought through. It
is entirely possible in the future they will flip on this. This was introduced
as a breaking change.

::: info VitePress 1.0.0-alpha.46 BREAKING CHANGES

build: base is now prepended to all internal (non-relative) links, including any
reference to a file present in the public directory. If you want the earlier
behavior for such links, use absolute links.

:::

Even the description for the breaking change is poorly written. The commit can
be seen
[here](https://github.com/vuejs/vitepress/commit/dcf29419f24bfb0fe99e424771be931bf77b9961).

The safest solution is to use the full path from the root of `/docs` or in the
case of the examples above,
`/reference/ois/latest/reserved-parameters.md#gasprice`. Doing so will safe
guard the docs from pattern substitutions by VitePress that could change in
future releases. This will inconvenience writers of the docs but will will save
countless hours tracking down bad links.
